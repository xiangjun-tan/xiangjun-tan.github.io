## About Me

My name is Xiangjun Tan, and I am a 4th-year undergraduate student at the [School of Physics, UNSW]([https://github.com](https://www.unsw.edu.au/science/our-schools/physics)). I am pursuing a double degree in Quantum Engineering and Physics. Previously, I have conducted experiments on the Quantum Hall Effect at temperatures below 250 mK and developed protocols for advanced quantum teleportation, as well as quantum simulations for many-body physics problem and error mitigation for its quantum algorithm. I am proficient in coding with Matlab, Python, and the C language, having completed numerous projects.

## Research Interests

- **Condensed Matter:** Quantum Hall Effect, Bandgap Theory
- **Quantum Simulation:** High Energy Particles Dynamics

## News and Awards

- **[Oct. 2023]** Our poster about Quantum Error Mitigation has been accepted by QPQIS2023.
- **[Feb. 2023]** Dean's honours list in Engineering 2022.
- **[Dec. 2022]** Sydney Quantum Academy Undergraduate Student Research Scholarship.

## Paper and Draft

- **[Introduction to Quantum Physics and Particle Physics](https://github.com/xiangjun-tan/Introduction-to-Quantum-Physics-and-Particle-Physics):**I want to write down a book for people who studied in non-physics background, just need a litlle linear algebra and statistic knowledge, for those who were really interested in QM&PP.(Currently in Chinese version but I will convert it into English after I finished it)
- **[Solid-State-Physics](https://github.com/xiangjun-tan/Solid-State-Physics):** I just want to write something to document what I learned and prevent forgetting those interesting topics.

## Education

- **UNSW 24fall:** Bachelor of Engineering/Bachelor of Science
- **Peking University:** Summer School 2022 for quantum technology
