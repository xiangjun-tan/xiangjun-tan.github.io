## About Me

My name is Xiangjun Tan, and I am a 4th-year undergraduate student at the [School of Physics, UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au/science/our-schools/physics). I am pursuing a double degree in Quantum Engineering and Physics. Previously, I have conducted experiments on the Quantum Hall Effect at temperatures below 250 mK and developed protocols for advanced quantum teleportation, as well as quantum simulations for many-body physics problem and error mitigation for its quantum algorithm. I am proficient in coding with Matlab, Python, and the C language, having completed numerous projects.

## Research Interests

- **Condensed Matter:** Quantum Hall Effect, Bandgap Theory
- **Quantum Simulation:** High Energy Particles Dynamics

## News and Awards

- **[Oct. 2023]** Our poster about Quantum Error Mitigation has been accepted by QPQIS2023.
- **[Feb. 2023]** Dean's honours list in Engineering 2022.
- **[Dec. 2022]** Sydney Quantum Academy Undergraduate Student Research Scholarship.

## Paper and Draft

- **[Introduction to Quantum Physics and Particle Physics](https://github.com/xiangjun-tan/Introduction-to-Quantum-Physics-and-Particle-Physics):** This book is crafted for enthusiasts from non-physics backgrounds with a foundational understanding of linear algebra and statistics. It aims to make quantum mechanics and particle physics accessible to those with a deep curiosity in the subjects. The content is currently available in Chinese, with plans to release an English version upon completion.
- **[Solid-State-Physics](https://github.com/xiangjun-tan/Solid-State-Physics):** This repository serves as a personal archive of my journey through solid-state physics. It's a collection of insights and key learnings from my academic pursuits, encapsulated to aid memory retention and to share my fascination with these compelling topics.

## Education

- **UNSW 24fall:** Bachelor of Engineering/Bachelor of Science
- **Peking University:** Summer School 2022 for quantum technology
