## About Me

I am a Research Assistant student at CFCS, Peking University, and interested in QIQC & HEP & CMP. I am also the president of the Research Seminar Association at UNSW, which has thousands of members, and we hold seminars on different topics every week. I've loved football and running for many years in my spare time.

## Research Interests

- **Condensed Matter:** Quantum Many-body Dynamics, Topological Phonon surface states
- **Quantum Simulation:** High Energy Particles Dynamics/ Dark matter(WIMP) scattering/ neutrino flavour evolution

## Github Repo

- **[Introduction to Quantum Physics and Particle Physics](https://github.com/xiangjun-tan/Introduction-to-Quantum-Physics-and-Particle-Physics):** This book is crafted for enthusiasts from non-physics backgrounds with a foundational understanding of linear algebra and statistics. It aims to make quantum mechanics and particle physics accessible to those with a deep curiosity in the subjects. The content is currently available in Chinese, and an English version will be released upon completion.
- **[Solid-State-Physics](https://github.com/xiangjun-tan/Solid-State-Physics):** This repository is a personal archive of my journey through solid-state physics. It's a collection of insights and key learnings from my academic pursuits; it also includes my project codes for simulating the material's magnetism with lattice defects.
