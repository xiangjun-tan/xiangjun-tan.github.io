## About Me

My name is Xiangjun Tan, and I am a 4th-year undergraduate student at the [School of Physics, UNSW]([https://github.com](https://www.unsw.edu.au/science/our-schools/physics)). I am pursuing a double degree in Quantum Engineering and Physics. During the summer of 2022, I participated in a Quantum Technology summer school program at Peking University. Previously, I have conducted experiments on the Quantum Hall Effect at temperatures below 250 mK and developed protocols for advanced quantum teleportation, as well as quantum simulations for many-body physics problem and error mitigation for its quantum algorithm. I am proficient in coding with Matlab, Python, and the C language, having completed numerous projects.

## Research Interests

- **Condensed Matter:** Quantum Hall Effect, Bandgap Theory
- **Quantum Simulation:** High Energy Particles Dynamics
