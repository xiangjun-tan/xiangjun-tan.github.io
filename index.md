## About Me

Xiangjun Tan is a PhD student at University College London in 2025, supervised by Prof. Sougato Bose. He is interested in QIQC and its application in HEP and CMP. He finished his Physics Honours degree under the supervision of Prof. Susan Coppersmith at the University of New South Wales, and the project was awarded $100,000 credits from IBM Quantum in 2024. He used to be a research assistant in the condensed matter theory group of Prof. Tiantian Zhang at the Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2023-2024). He was also the founder and the former president (2023-2024) of the Research Seminar Association at the University of New South Wales, which has thousands of student members.

## Research Interests

- **Condensed Matter:** Many-body Dynamics, Topological Phonon surface states
- **Quantum Simulation:** High Energy Particles Dynamics/ Dark matter(WIMP) scattering/ neutrino flavour evolution

## Github Repo

- **[Introduction to Quantum Physics and Particle Physics](https://github.com/xiangjun-tan/Introduction-to-Quantum-Physics-and-Particle-Physics):** This book is crafted for enthusiasts from non-physics backgrounds with a foundational understanding of linear algebra and statistics. It aims to make quantum mechanics and particle physics accessible to those with a deep curiosity in the subjects. The content is currently available in Chinese, and an English version will be released upon completion.
- **[Solid-State-Physics](https://github.com/xiangjun-tan/Solid-State-Physics):** This repository is a personal archive of my journey through solid-state physics. It's a collection of insights and key learnings from my academic pursuits; it also includes my project codes for simulating the material's magnetism with lattice defects.
